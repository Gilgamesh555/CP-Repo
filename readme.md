# Competitive Programming Training
## Introduction

The original purpose of this repo its to train my CP abilities and have a foot of the problem I solved
since it was almost 3 years that I did not practice I am trying the 1400 range problems of Codeforces
hope that this repo could help anyone that want to see some solution of some problem that not understand
or does not exist in the editorial.

It also contains some solutions of some contests but since my ability its not that good yet, it only will
have the most easy ones

## Suggestions

hear any suggestion or idea related with that. For now its only a repo that contain resources of solutions
